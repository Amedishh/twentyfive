      <h3>

        1. Central Processing Unit (CPU)
        - The CPU is the brain of the computer. It performs calculations, <br> executes instructions from programs, and controls all other components. Itâ€™s responsible <br> for most of the data processing. 
        <br>
        <img id="AMD-CPU" src="img/AMD CPU.png" alt="">
        <br>
        <br>

           
        
        2. Motherboard
        - The motherboard is the main circuit board that connects all components of the PC, including the CPU, memory, storage, and peripherals. It also houses the chipset, which helps manage data flow between components.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        
        3. Random Access Memory (RAM)
        - RAM is the computer's short-term memory. It temporarily stores data and instructions that the CPU needs while performing tasks. The more RAM a system has, the more data it can process at once, leading to better performance.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        
        4. Storage (HDD, SSD)
        - Storage devices, like Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) and Solid-State Drives (SSDs), store data permanently (until deleted). SSDs are faster and more durable than HDDs. They hold your operating system, applications, and files.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        
        5. Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)
        - The GPU, or video card, is responsible for rendering images and video. It performs the heavy lifting for graphics-intensive tasks like gaming, video editing, and 3D rendering. Some CPUs have integrated GPUs, but dedicated GPUs are typically more powerful.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        
        6. Power Supply Unit (PSU)
        - The PSU converts electrical power from a wall outlet into a form that the components of the PC can use. It supplies power to the motherboard, CPU, GPU, storage devices, and other peripherals.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        
        7. Cooling System (Fans, Heat Sinks, Liquid Cooling)
        - Cooling systems help regulate the temperature of the components, particularly the CPU and GPU. Without proper cooling, the system could overheat and cause damage. Cooling methods include fans, heat sinks, and in some cases, liquid cooling systems.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        
        8. Optical Drive (CD/DVD/Blu-ray)
        - Optical drives read and write data to optical discs like CDs, DVDs, and Blu-rays. They are less common today as digital downloads and streaming have taken over.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        
        9. Input Devices (Keyboard, Mouse, etc.)
        - These are the devices that allow you to interact with the computer. The keyboard is for typing, the mouse is for pointing and clicking, and other devices like trackpads and game controllers are also common.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        
        10. Output Devices (Monitor, Printer, Speakers)
        - Output devices allow you to receive information from the computer. Monitors display visual output, printers create hard copies of documents, and speakers provide audio output.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        
        11. Expansion Cards
        - These are add-on cards that enhance the functionality of the computer. Common types include sound cards, network cards, and additional USB or HDMI ports.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        
        12. Case/Chassis
        - The case houses and protects all the computer components. It also helps with airflow and cooling, keeping everything in place.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        
        13. Network Interface Card (NIC)
        - The NIC allows the computer to connect to networks, either via Ethernet or Wi-Fi. It's responsible for network communication, including internet access.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        
        14. BIOS/UEFI (Firmware)
        - The BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) or UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) is software stored on the motherboard. It initializes and tests hardware components when the computer starts and provides a setup interface for users to configure system settings.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        
        These are the key parts of a computer and what they do, working together to provide the full computing experience! <p></p>
