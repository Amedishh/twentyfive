            Benchmarks in the context of PCs refer to standardized tests that evaluate the performance of hardware components, like the CPU (Central Processing Unit), GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), and other parts of the system. These tests are designed to measure how well a specific piece of hardware performs under various workloads or conditions. Benchmarks give users and professionals a way to compare different hardware to make informed decisions based on performance.
            <br>
            <br>

            Why Benchmarks Are Important for PCs: <br>
            Comparing Performance: Benchmarks help compare the performance of different CPUs, GPUs, or systems. For example, you can compare two different CPUs to see which one performs better in gaming, multitasking, or other tasks.

            Optimization: By running benchmarks, users can identify bottlenecks in their system and optimize their setup for better performance.

            Real-World Performance: Benchmarks help predict how hardware will perform in real-world scenarios, like gaming, video editing, or running software applications.

            Overclocking and Stress Testing: When users tweak or overclock their hardware, benchmarks are used to check whether the system remains stable and performs as expected.

            <br>

            Why Are GPUs and CPUs Stress Tested? <br>
            Stress testing is a critical part of the benchmarking process, especially for high-performance tasks. Stress testing intentionally pushes the CPU or GPU to their maximum capabilities to simulate extreme conditions, ensuring that the hardware can handle demanding tasks without failure or instability.
            <br>
            Stress Testing of CPUs:
            Purpose: Stress testing a CPU helps ensure that the processor can handle heavy workloads for extended periods. It is often used to test stability when overclocking a CPU, ensuring that the system won't crash or overheat.
            <br>
            <br>

            Why it's Important: <br>

            Overclocking: Overclocking increases the performance of a CPU beyond its rated speed. Stress testing confirms that the CPU remains stable when running at higher speeds and voltages.

            Thermal Limits: Stress testing helps measure how much heat the CPU generates during intensive operations. It ensures the CPU's cooling solution is sufficient to prevent overheating.

            Stability: Stress testing under load ensures the CPU is stable and will not crash under sustained heavy usage, such as video rendering, running multiple applications, or gaming.

            Stress Testing of GPUs:
            Purpose: Similar to CPUs, GPUs are stress tested to push them to their limits and assess their ability to handle high-resolution gaming, video rendering, and graphical tasks.
            <br>
            <br>


            Gaming and Rendering: GPUs are responsible for rendering graphics in games and applications. Stress testing ensures that they can handle heavy graphical workloads without crashing or exhibiting artifacts (glitches or visual errors).

            Overclocking: Like CPUs, GPUs can also be overclocked to increase performance. Stress testing ensures the GPU runs stably at these higher clock speeds and voltages.

            Thermal Management: GPUs can generate a significant amount of heat when under load, so stress testing helps evaluate how well the cooling system handles that heat. It can prevent overheating issues, which could damage the GPU.

            Stability: Stress testing checks whether the GPU will remain stable during long gaming sessions or when running intensive tasks like 3D rendering, VR, or complex simulations.
